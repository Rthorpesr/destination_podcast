<h1>Destination-Podcast<h1>
  
  
  <p> Destination-Podcast is a MVP application used to consolidate two helpful applications into a single place for the user.<p>
  <p> Using the Listen Notes API and the Mapquest API we have developed an application that allows the user to search for gps <p>
  <p> directions using Mapquest.  Depending on the length of the trip the Listen Notes API will fetch a list of podcasts that <p>
  <p> correspond with the length of the user's trip.  Allowing the user to focus on the road instead constantly checking their phone <p>
